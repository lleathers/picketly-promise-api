Purpose:
Preserve the conceptual, economic, and institutional invariants of Picketly
across implementations, contributors, and AI collaborators.

This document is binding.
Where other explanations conflict, this packet governs.

## I. Core Definition: Promise

A **promise** in Picketly is a structured, inspectable, socially legible
**forward contract of indeterminate delivery**.

A promise functions as a **payment instrument** when and only when it is
**accepted by a seller in a transaction**, following fiduciary risk assessment.

Promises:
- may be exchanged in whole or fractional units,
- may be redeemed at any time after acceptance,
- may only be redeemed in whole units,
- are subject to seller-side risk assessment prior to acceptance.

A promise is not a donation, pledge, or expression of goodwill.
It is a conditional payment vehicle whose status depends on acceptance.

---

## II. Promise Artwork as an Economic Primitive (Canonical)

Promise artwork is an **economic primitive**, not an aesthetic layer.

It exists to represent promises in ways that are:
- culturally legible,
- reputationally meaningful,
- exchange-enabling across promise markets.

Promise artwork is **media-agnostic**.
No universal format, medium, or exhibition form is imposed.

Each promise market determines acceptable forms of promise representation.

---

## III. Canonical Definition: Promise Artwork

**Promise artwork** is a **licensed cultural artifact of any media type**
used to represent, identify, and legitimize a promise within a promise market.

Promise artwork:
- may be visual, auditory, spatial, kinetic, textual, physical, digital,
  augmented, or mixed-media,
- may exist as an object, signal, performance, sequence, or environment,
- is not limited to what can be “visualized.”

Promise artwork compresses a promise’s identity and guarantees
into a recognizable, mnemonic form.

---

## IV. Relationship Between Art Markets and Promise Markets

Picketly deliberately creates **mutual influence** between:

- art as an independent commodity, and
- promises as economic instruments.

### Artists
Artists may license artworks to promise makers for the exclusive purpose
of promise representation and exhibition.

Artists who license work to trustworthy promise makers:
- tacitly legitimize those promises,
- protect their reputations through selective association,
- may enjoy increased valuation of their artistic corpus.

### Promise Makers
Promise makers who successfully license artwork from respected artists:
- may enjoy preferred valuation by association,
- may signal seriousness and credibility,
- may attract counterparties more efficiently.

This mutual influence is intentional and foundational.

---

## V. Exhibition Contexts (Strictly Distinguished)

Promise artwork has **two legitimate exhibition contexts**.
They must never be conflated.

### A. Promise-Maker Exhibition (Market Signaling)

When exhibited by the **promise maker**, promise artwork functions as
a **market signal**.

It:
- signals the existence and type of a promise,
- attracts other promise makers for exchange,
- supports liquidity formation,
- does NOT imply seller acceptance.

This role is analogous to currency design:
artwork signals value type, not endorsement.

---

### B. Seller / Promise-Bearer Exhibition (Acknowledgment & Brokerage)

When exhibited by a **seller or promise bearer**, promise artwork functions as:
- acknowledgment of payment,
- implied brokerage and endorsement,
- allocation of scarce reputational surface area.

Seller-side exhibition is granted **only after acceptance of a promise as payment**.

Analogy:
A racing team displays sponsor decals only after a sponsorship agreement
has been executed.

---

### Absolute Constraint

Seller-side exhibition of promise artwork prior to acceptance is prohibited.

Exhibition is a benefit delivered after a transaction,
not an inducement offered before one.

---

## VI. Exhibition Rights and Conditions

Promise artwork exhibition is governed jointly by:
- the artist’s licensing conditions, and
- the promise maker’s visibility conditions.

Conditions may specify:
- permitted audiences,
- permitted venues or media,
- duration of exhibition,
- transformation or derivative rights.

A promise bearer may exhibit promise artwork
only within these declared constraints.

---

## VII. Promise Lifecycle (Authoritative)

1. Declaration  
   Seller declares acceptable payment instruments and needs.

2. Bid  
   Buyer offers a promise as payment.

3. Verification  
   Proof of identity and reachability (e.g., magic link).

4. Holding & Risk Assessment  
   Seller performs fiduciary evaluation of capacity and character.

5. Acceptance  
   Transaction boundary: promise becomes payment.

6. Exhibition  
   Seller grants artwork exhibition under defined conditions.

7. Redemption & Performance  
   Promise is redeemed in whole units upon request.

8. Market Memory & Liquidity Formation  
   Historical performance informs valuation and negotiability.

---

## VIII. Organizer–Visitor–Promise Loop (Invariant)

Institutions are not designed first and funded second.

They are **discovered through accepted promises**.

1. Organizer declares mission and acceptable payments.
2. Visitors self-select commitments via the infinite funnel.
3. Promises are bid and verified.
4. Seller assesses risk.
5. Seller accepts promises as payment.
6. Seller grants artwork exhibition.
7. Institution reorganizes based on accepted commitments.

---

## IX. Non-Negotiable Principles

- Promises are payment instruments when accepted.
- Exhibition space is scarce economic capital.
- Seller fiduciary duty dominates growth convenience.
- Due diligence is experiential, not purely digital.
- Infinite funnels enable class-inclusive institutions.
- Promise artwork is media-agnostic and licensed.

Any proposal violating these principles is invalid.

---

## X. Anti-Limitation Clause (Binding)

No collaborator may:
- restrict promise artwork to visual media,
- assume promise artwork is created by the promise maker,
- treat artwork as branding or decoration,
- impose exhibition formats not specified by the promise market,
- grant seller-side exhibition prior to acceptance.

Such restrictions violate the canon.

## XI. Instruction to Future Collaborators

Before proposing solutions:

1. Read this document in full.
2. Treat all definitions as binding.
3. Preserve seller fiduciary control.
4. Preserve media-agnostic promise artwork.
5. Avoid collapsing promises into donations or pledges.

This packet supersedes prior informal explanations.
